# ShopAds
In any economy, advertising is a wonderful tool to get things moving, now you can get it in your servers economy, without all the spammy messing!

Shop Ads lets your players pay in-game to have the server broadcast an ad for their shop or business. Optionally you can then have others warp to that shop, check it out and be popped back where they were before once they have had a good look.

Players pay depending on how many hours they want their ad to run for and Shop Ads handles all warps and costs.
